A fun project containing my CV as Public API :)


Using:  
Swagger-ui template( from Swagger-UI github https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui )  
Java 11(JDK8+ should work as well)  
MongoDB as database  
Gradle to dependency manager  
Spring boot(with spring-data-mongodb)

How to create yours:

1 - Star this repository :)  
2 - Clone this repo :)  
3 - Change the 'MyOwnCvApplication'
4 - Spring framework should load this information(into mongoDB[see application.properties to details]) when the application starts
5 - Use Heroku to deploy it!

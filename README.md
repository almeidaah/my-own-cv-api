A fun project containing my CV as Public API :)


**Using:** . 

Swagger-ui template( from Swagger-UI github https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui )__
_Java 11(JDK8+ should work as well)_ . 
_MongoDB as database_ . 
_Gradle to dependency manager_ . 
_Spring boot(with spring-data-mongodb)_ . 

**How to create yours:** . 

1. Star this repository :)  
2. Clone this repo :)  
3. Change class ```MySelfDocsConfig.java``` and put the API basic information.  
4. Change class ```MyOwnCvApplication.java``` and put your information.  
5. Spring framework should load this information(into mongoDB[see application.properties to details]) when the application starts .  
6. Use Heroku to deploy it! 
7. Share :)
